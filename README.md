# Etch-A-Sketch Simulator

Etch-A-Sketch Simulator is a basic web application between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. I built this project to demonstrate my DOM manipulation skills.

## Instructions

1. Open this link: [Etch-A-Sketch Simulator](https://edwrddz6.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)
2. Using the cursor, click and hold on your mouse to draw on the main grid.
3. To change color, click on 'Color Selector'.
4. To increase the grid size, move the slider from left to right.
5. To erase, click on the 'Eraser' button. Click and hold the cursor to apply.
6. To clear the grid, click on 'Clear'.
